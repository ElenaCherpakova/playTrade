## User Authentication & Management

### User Authentication

Our application ensures secure user management through:

- **Registration**: Securely registers new users.
- **Login and Logout**: Manages sessions securely from creation to termination.
- **Password Management**: Includes methods for setting, updating, and verifying passwords.
- **JWT Token Creation**: Generates JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.

### Session Management with NextAuth.js

We utilize NextAuth.js configured in `api/auth/[...nextauth].js` for centralized, dynamic session management:

- **JWT and Session Synchronization**: Custom callbacks enrich JWTs with user details for consistent sessions.
- **Secure Session Handling**: Uses HTTP-only cookies for secure, scalable session management.

**Configuration**:

```js
session: {
  strategy: "jwt"
},
secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET,
pages: {
  signIn: "/signin"
}
```
